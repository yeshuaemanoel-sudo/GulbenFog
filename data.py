    "content": """hey family

ive been looking for a couple people who have committed very heinous and immoral crimes to people
i know but theyre very good at hiding their traces. they have previously used federally registered
companies as cash laundering mules but the addresses and info listed on their corporation filings
doesn't go anywhere.

Ive pulled a myriad of addresses, phone # and emails from various sources but they seem to be dead/not in
use anymore and following the trail has been very hard. i have a general knowledge of an area where they
stay within however i have not been able to pinpoint them. i have strong fears of going to the police
because they are almost certainly on these persons payroll (several criminal cases against these persons
have been left as cold cases despite a mountain of evidence). ive scoped out their past addresses and sent
people to verify if they reside there and have not been able to confirm anything.

i would be very grateful if anyone could point me in a new direction because i feel like ive hit a dead end.
